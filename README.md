# 2016-House-Burglary-in-Taipei-City

>* Motivation: <br />
In 2015, Taipei city government released the data of locations of house, vehicle and bike burglaries. With these data, the public and the government know where the key areas for the crimes are, which becomes a reference for the public considering where to live and the government formulating policies to lower the burglary rate. <p>
However, if we only consider the intensity of burglary in a certain region, it may be biased because of more people living there or lots of other factors.<p>
Therefore, I would like to combine the Taipei city surveillance camera data with house burglary data to analyze because I think surveillance system plays an important role of preventing crime and also breaking cases. 


>* What I do: <br />
>1. Burglary Map <br />
>2. Nearby Surveillance Cameras (within 1 km) VS Burglary Repeated Times Analysis <br />
>3. Burglary Rate Prediction (using Markov chain Monte Carlo)
